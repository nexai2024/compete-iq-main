## 2025-05-15 - Dynamic Focus and Differentiated ARIA Labels
**Learning:** For dynamic lists where items can be added, auto-focusing the primary input of the new item significantly reduces user friction. Additionally, repetitive buttons in a list (like "Remove") should have unique ARIA labels (e.g., using the item index) to provide better context for screen reader users.
**Action:** Always implement focus management for dynamic list additions and ensure icon-only buttons in lists have differentiated aria-labels.
